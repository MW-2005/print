# Read about the sep argument on the W3Schools documentation. sep is an optional argument. One that can be set if we
# we want to. To set an optional argument, we specify its name, or its identifier. Then we use the equals sign,
# followed by a string that will act as the separator.

print('Separating', 'words', 'with', 'something', 'new!', sep='@')

# When specifying the sep argument, you must set it as the last argument in the function.

# Project 2.1
#   1) Print your first and last name separated with _ by using the sep argument.
#   2) Print the date in numerical form, using the / as the sep argument for the separator between the numbers.
#   3) Print abc separated with ### between each letter.
