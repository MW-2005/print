# This is you first project! Today you will be familiarizing yourself with the print() statement.
# What you are reading right now is a comment, which is annotation in source code. Don't worry about it too much, just
# think of it as text that's ignored.
#
# Projects / Exercises will typically contain comments that are instructions. They're also will be stuff like links to
# documentation, hints, and other useful information in comments, so be sure to read them. To make sure that the
# comments are being read, for the date of this file, write 00/00/0000 instead of the actual date.
#
# Comments will also include information like /example output/. This is what your program's output in the
# terminal should look like. It doesn't have to match exactly, but it should be close.
#
# Be sure to write your name and date at the top of the file. You should do this everytime you write your programs.
